# BadSuperbowlNamer
As a mediocre superbowl naming person
I want an application that will translate numbers into roman numerals
So that I don't make a mistake when naming all of the superbowls.

[Test Cases](https://www.notion.so/bf873692f78e45f8b634397459a3e6fd)

given the number 1

when translating to roman numerals

then the result should be 'I'
